# OOMWOO Contributions — RFC board

Each folder here is a **Request for Contribution (RFC)** — a self-contained module
(software, firmware, hardware, or procurement) you can pick up and build. Submit
your work under `contributions/<rfc>/<your-github-username>/`. New here? Read
[CONTRIBUTING](../docs/CONTRIBUTING.md), and see the
[RFC lifecycle](../docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#rfc-lifecycle) for how RFCs progress and
retire.

**Status legend** — *Active:* `exploratory` → `ready to start work` /
`design-first` → `in progress`. *Retired* (closed to new contributions, but
**kept in place** for provenance): `completed` · `superseded` · `descoped` ·
`merged`.

**This board is canonical** for every RFC's status and progress. An RFC's own
README describes its scope and how to get started; where its `> Status —` line
disagrees with the row below, the row below wins. Update this board when you land
work.

**Progress** is a rough, self-reported percentage of the RFC's scope — a sense of
"how much is left", not a promise:
![>=75%](https://img.shields.io/badge/%3E%3D75%25-brightgreen) nearly there ·
![25-74%](https://img.shields.io/badge/25--74%25-yellow) under way ·
![<25%](https://img.shields.io/badge/%3C25%25-red) barely started / open.

> **Two builds.** OOMWOO comes in a *basic* version (vacuum only, simple to
> assemble, charging-only dock) and a *full-featured* one (mop, auto-empty,
> extendable side brush). Some RFCs serve only the full build - mop lift in
> floor-care, the auto-empty dock in dock-cycle - so check which you are
> targeting before you start.

> **Core mechanical design is not an RFC.** The chassis, brushes, mop, wheel
> mounts and shell are designed in-house and tracked in
> [oomwoo-one-cad](https://github.com/makerspet/oomwoo-one-cad) — a tightly-coupled
> reference design is slow and messy to settle by consensus. Planned hardware
> modules are listed in the [RFC backlog](../docs/RFC_BACKLOG.md); a well-defined,
> standalone piece (a mount, a spec, a part model) graduates to an RFC here.
